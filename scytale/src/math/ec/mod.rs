//! The NIST prime curves, P-256 and P-384: the arithmetic under both
//! ECDH and ECDSA, and the key handling the two schemes share.
//!
//! Each curve is `y^2 = x^3 - 3x + b` over a prime field, with a
//! base point of prime order `n`, so every point but the identity
//! generates the whole group and there is no cofactor to clear. The
//! field and the scalar ring both run on [`Montgomery`], which is
//! generic over the width; nothing here is specialised to a curve
//! beyond its constants and the table of multiples of its base
//! point in [`base`], so a third curve is those two things away.
//!
//! # Constant time
//!
//! Every scalar multiplication is a fixed sequence of field
//! operations, and every table read scans the whole table, so the
//! digit that chooses an entry never becomes an index or a branch.
//!
//! A multiplication of the base point reads per-window tables of
//! affine multiples where the curve carries them, which P-256 does:
//! a signed seven-bit digit for each of 37 windows, 64 entries a
//! window, and no doublings at all, since every entry is already
//! shifted to where it belongs. P-384, whose table at that width
//! would be 338 KB, keeps the four combs described in [`base`] and
//! the complete projective formulas of Renes, Costello and Batina
//! (2016) for `a = -3`, whose addition handles doubling, the
//! identity and inverse pairs with no case analysis.
//!
//! A multiplication of any other point is Jacobian, in signed
//! five-bit windows, where a doubling costs three multiplications
//! and five squarings rather than eight and three. That addition is
//! not complete, and each case it misses is settled by a mask rather
//! than a branch: either point being the identity takes the other,
//! and inverse pairs the formula handles itself. The remaining case,
//! two equal points, cannot arise in a windowed multiplication of a
//! scalar below the group order, for the reason
//! [`Engine::jacobian_add_affine`] sets out, so no table of doubles
//! is kept for it; the tables built here, where consecutive
//! multiples do meet, hand the addition the double itself.
//!
//! Inversion and square roots are exponentiations, whose exponent is
//! a constant of the curve rather than a secret, so the windows are
//! slid over it while the value being inverted steers nothing. For
//! P-256 the inversion is a fixed chain of 255 squarings and 13
//! multiplications, written out in [`x86_64`] where the processor
//! has the instructions.
//!
//! The only value-dependent control flow is the retry ECDSA makes
//! when a nonce yields a zero `r` or `s`, which happens once in
//! 2^256 signatures.
