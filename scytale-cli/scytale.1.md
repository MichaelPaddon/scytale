## NAME

scytale - cryptographic command line tool

## SYNOPSIS

**scytale** *command* \[*verb*\] *algorithm* \[*options*\] \[*file*\]  
**scytale list** \[*family*\] \[**--long**\]  
**scytale** *command* \[*verb*\] **--help**

## DESCRIPTION

**scytale** runs the operations of the scytale library from the command
line, one command per module of the library: **hash**, **mac**,
**aead**, **cipher**, **kdf**, **key**, **sig**, **kex**, **kem**,
**pke** and **random**.

The algorithm is the operation. It is the first word after the verb on
every call, never an option and never defaulted, so a script says what
it does and a reader need not know a default: **scytale hash sha256**
*file*, **scytale aead encrypt aes-256-gcm** and so on. A name is
matched without regard to case, and **\_** and **-** are interchangeable
in it. A name that is not known is refused with the nearest names that
are.

Input is standard input, or the *file* named last on the command line.
Output is standard output, or the file named by **-o**. A file that
holds a secret, whether a generated key, a shared secret or a derived
key, is created readable by its owner alone.

Every option that carries bytes, such as a key, IV, nonce, tag, salt,
signature or label, is written with a prefix that says how to read it
(see **VALUES**). The algorithm fixes the length of a key, IV or nonce,
and a value of another length is refused with both lengths in the
message: nothing is padded or cut to fit.

## VALUES

**hex:***digits*  
Hex, in either case: no **0x**, no separators, and an even count of
digits.

**file:***path*  
The raw bytes of the file, all of them.

**fd:***n*  
The raw bytes read to the end of descriptor *n*, for **3\<** *keyfile*
in a script.

**env:***name*  
The value of the environment variable *name*, as hex.

**str:***text*  
The text itself. Allowed for additional data, labels, salts, contexts
and passwords; refused for a key, since a key typed as text is a
password without a key derivation.

A value without a prefix is an error. A key given as **hex:** on the
command line is visible to every process on the machine through
**ps**(1) and stays in the shell's history, so **file:** or **fd:** is
the better form for one; there is nothing wrong with **hex:** for a
nonce or a salt, or in a script that already holds the key that way.

## OPTIONS

Every option has a long form, and the long form is what the text below
refers to. The short forms, where a command has them:

**-k**, **--key**  
A key value, or for the public-key commands a private key file.

**-p**, **--public**  
A public key file; for **kex agree** the option is **--peer**.

**-s**, **--signature**  
A signature value.

**-t**, **--tag**  
A tag value, for **mac verify**.

**-n**, **--nonce**  
A nonce value.

**-l**, **--length**  
An output length in bytes.

**-i**, **--iterations**  
An iteration count.

**-o**, **--out**  
The output file, in place of standard output.

**--hex**, **--raw**  
How bytes are written: hex and a newline, or the bytes themselves. Each
command says below which it does without either. The two exclude each
other.

**-h**, **--help**  
The help for a command, ending with the value syntax and the exit codes.

**-V**, **--version**  
The version.

## COMMANDS

## list

**scytale list** \[*family*\] \[**--long**\]

Prints the algorithm names each command takes, one per line, for a
script to check. With a *family* (one of **hash**, **mac**, **aead**,
**cipher**, **kdf**, **key**, **sig**, **kex**, **kem**, **pke**) the
names alone; without one, every name prefixed by its family. With
**--long** each line goes on to say what the name takes: the key, nonce,
tag and output lengths, and which options it has.

## random

**scytale random** \[**--hex**\|**--raw**\] \[*-o file*\] *count*

*count* bytes from the system-seeded CTR_DRBG. Hex without a flag.

## hash

**scytale hash** *algorithm* \[*-l length*\] \[*--function-name value*\]
\[*--customization value*\] \[**--hex**\|**--raw**\] \[*file...*\]

A digest of each file, or of standard input, as hex followed by two
spaces and the file's name, in the layout of **sha256sum**(1); standard
input is named **-**. With **--raw** the digest alone, for one file at
most.

*algorithm*  
One of **sha1**, **sha224**, **sha256**, **sha384**, **sha512**,
**sha512-224**, **sha512-256**, **sha3-224**, **sha3-256**,
**sha3-384**, **sha3-512**, or an extendable-output function,
**shake128**, **shake256**, **cshake128** or **cshake256**.

**-l, --length ***bytes*  
The output length, required for an extendable-output function and
refused otherwise.

**--function-name ***value***, --customization ***value*  
The cSHAKE function name and customization string, as **VALUES**; empty
without them, refused for the other hashes.

## mac tag, mac verify

**scytale mac tag** *algorithm* **-k ***key* \[*-l length*\]
\[*--customization value*\] \[**--hex**\|**--raw**\] \[*file*\]  
**scytale mac verify** *algorithm* **-k ***key* **-t ***tag* \[*-l
length*\] \[*--customization value*\] \[*file*\]

**tag** writes a tag over the input, hex without a flag. **verify**
checks the input against *tag* instead: nothing is printed, and the exit
status says whether it matched.

*algorithm*  
One of **hmac-***hash* for any hash above (**hmac-sha256**,
**hmac-sha3-512**, ...), **cmac-aes-128**, **cmac-aes-192**,
**cmac-aes-256**, **kmac128**, **kmac256** or **poly1305**.

**-k, --key ***value*  
The key. HMAC and KMAC take any length; CMAC takes the cipher's, and
Poly1305 32 bytes. A Poly1305 key is for one message only.

**-l, --length ***bytes*  
The tag length, for KMAC: 32 bytes for **kmac128** and 64 for
**kmac256** without it.

**--customization ***value*  
The KMAC customization string.

## aead encrypt, aead decrypt

**scytale aead** {**encrypt**\|**decrypt**} *algorithm* **-k ***key*
**-n ***nonce* \[*--aad value*\] \[*--tag-length bytes*\] \[*-o file*\]
\[*file*\]

Authenticated encryption. Encryption writes the ciphertext and then the
tag; decryption reads ciphertext and tag as one input, checks the tag,
and writes the plaintext only if it checked. A message that fails leaves
standard output empty and exits with status 1. Encryption with GCM and
ChaCha20-Poly1305 streams; decryption reads the whole input first, since
plaintext handed out before the tag is checked is plaintext an attacker
chose.

*algorithm*  
One of **aes-128-gcm**, **aes-192-gcm**, **aes-256-gcm**,
**aes-128-gcm-siv**, **aes-256-gcm-siv**, **aes-128-ccm**,
**aes-192-ccm**, **aes-256-ccm**, **aes-128-xpn**, **aes-192-xpn**,
**aes-256-xpn**, **chacha20-poly1305**.

**-k, --key ***value*  
The key, of the width the name says: 16, 24 or 32 bytes for AES, 32 for
ChaCha20-Poly1305.

**-n, --nonce ***value*  
The nonce. Twelve bytes, except that GCM takes any length, CCM takes 7
to 13, and XPN takes 24: the 12-byte salt followed by the 12-byte frame.
A nonce must never repeat under one key.

**--aad ***value*  
Additional data, authenticated but not encrypted; the same value must be
given to decrypt. Empty without it.

**--tag-length ***bytes*  
The tag length, 16 by default. GCM and XPN take 4 to 16, CCM an even
number from 4 to 16; GCM-SIV and ChaCha20-Poly1305 take 16 only.

## cipher encrypt, cipher decrypt

**scytale cipher** {**encrypt**\|**decrypt**} *algorithm* **-k ***key*
\[*--iv value*\] \[*-n nonce*\] \[*--counter n*\] \[*--padding
pkcs7\|none*\] \[*--tweak-key key*\] \[*--alphabet chars*\] \[*--tweak
value*\] \[*-o file*\] \[*file*\]

The unauthenticated modes. Nothing here checks that a message is what
was encrypted; a script that needs to know that wants **aead**. These
are for a protocol that brings its own MAC, a disk, or a format to
preserve. An option the algorithm does not take is refused, and the
message says which algorithm it is for.

*algorithm*  
**aes-***width***-***mode* for a *width* of 128, 192 or 256 and a *mode*
of **ecb**, **cbc**, **ctr**, **cfb1**, **cfb8**, **cfb128**, **ofb** or
**xts**; **chacha20**; **ff1-aes-***width* or **ff3-1-aes-***width* for
the format-preserving modes. **kw** and **kwp** are under **cipher
wrap**.

**-k, --key ***value*  
The key, of the cipher's width.

**--iv ***value*  
One 16-byte block: the IV for CBC, CFB and OFB, the first counter block
for CTR, the tweak for XTS. Required by those modes and refused by the
others.

**-n, --nonce ***value***, --counter ***n*  
The 12-byte nonce and the first block counter (0 without it) for
ChaCha20, which encrypts and decrypts with the one operation.

**--padding ***pkcs7***\|***none*  
Required for ECB, CBC and CFB128, which take whole blocks, and refused
by the rest. **pkcs7** adds PKCS#7 padding on encryption and removes it
on decryption, and is what **openssl enc** and CMS use; **none** refuses
an input that is not whole blocks. Padding that does not check on
decryption exits with status 1 and prints nothing; a script must not
report that difference to anyone who can submit ciphertexts.

**--tweak-key ***value*  
The second key for XTS, of the cipher's width and different from the
first. Required by XTS, refused by the rest.

**--alphabet ***chars***, --tweak ***value*  
For FF1 and FF3-1, which read and write lines of text in the alphabet,
one message per line. The alphabet is the string of characters that are
the numerals, in order; the decimal digits without it. The tweak is any
length for FF1 and exactly 7 bytes for FF3-1; empty for FF1 without it.
These modes are not constant time.

CTR, OFB and CFB take any length and stream; CBC, CFB128 and ECB stream
a block at a time; CFB1, XTS and the format-preserving modes read the
whole input.

## cipher wrap, cipher unwrap

**scytale cipher** {**wrap**\|**unwrap**} *algorithm* **-k ***key* \[*-o
file*\] \[*file*\]

Key wrapping (RFC 3394, RFC 5649): the input is a key, and the output is
it under the wrapping key with an 8-byte check value. *algorithm* is
**aes-***width***-kw** for a key that is whole 8-byte blocks, two or
more, or **aes-***width***-kwp** for a key of any length. A wrapped key
that does not check on unwrapping exits with status 1.

## kdf hkdf

**scytale kdf hkdf** *hash* **--ikm ***value* \[*--salt value*\]
\[*--info value*...\] **-l ***bytes* \[**--hex**\|**--raw**\] \[*-o
file*\]

HKDF (RFC 5869) over *hash*, any of the plain hashes above: keys from
keying material that is already unguessable, such as a shared secret.
The input keying material may not be given as **str:**. **--info** may
repeat; the values are concatenated in order. Hex without a flag.

## kdf pbkdf2

**scytale kdf pbkdf2** *hash* **--password ***value* **--salt ***value*
**-i ***iterations* **-l ***bytes* \[**--hex**\|**--raw**\] \[*-o
file*\]

PBKDF2 (RFC 8018) over *hash*: a key from a password, which is
guessable, at a cost per guess set by the iteration count. The password
and salt may be given as **str:**. Hex without a flag.

## key generate

**scytale key generate** *algorithm* \[*-o file*\]

A new private key, as a PEM **PRIVATE KEY** block (PKCS#8), to standard
output or to *file*, created readable by its owner alone. The algorithm
is one of **ed25519**, **x25519**, **ecdsa-p256**, **ecdsa-p384**,
**ecdh-p256**, **ecdh-p384**, **rsa-***bits* for any *bits* from 1024 to
8192, **ml-kem-512**, **ml-kem-768**, **ml-kem-1024**, **ml-dsa-44**,
**ml-dsa-65**, **ml-dsa-87**, or **slh-dsa-***hash***-***size***s** and
**slh-dsa-***hash***-***size***f** for a *hash* of **sha2** or **shake**
and a *size* of 128, 192 or 256. Keys on P-256 and P-384 serve both
ECDSA and ECDH; an RSA key serves both signatures and encryption.

## key public

**scytale key public** \[*file*\] \[*-o file*\]

The public half of the private key in *file*, or standard input, as a
PEM **PUBLIC KEY** block.

## key show

**scytale key show** \[*file*\]

Prints what a key file holds: its algorithm, which half it is, and for
RSA the modulus length.

Every command that takes a key file reads PEM: the **PRIVATE KEY** and
**PUBLIC KEY** blocks that **openssl**(1) and everything else write, and
the bare **RSA PRIVATE KEY**, **RSA PUBLIC KEY** and **EC PRIVATE KEY**
forms as well. A command names the scheme it runs and checks the file
holds a key for it; a file that holds another kind of key, or the wrong
half, is refused with a message saying what it holds.

## sig sign

**scytale sig sign** *scheme* **-k ***private* \[*--context value*\]
\[**--raw-ecdsa**\] \[**--hex**\|**--raw**\] \[*-o file*\] \[*file*\]

Signs the input with the private key in *private*, writing the signature
as raw bytes without a flag.

## sig verify

**scytale sig verify** *scheme* **-p ***public* **-s ***signature*
\[*--context value*\] \[**--raw-ecdsa**\] \[*file*\]

Checks *signature* (a value, as **VALUES**) over the input under the
public key in *public*. Nothing is printed; the exit status is 0 if it
verified and 1 if not. A private key file is refused here; **key
public** makes the public one.

*scheme*  
**ed25519** on an Ed25519 key; **ecdsa-***hash* on a P-256 or P-384 key,
the curve being the key's; **rsa-pss-***hash* on an RSA or RSA-PSS key,
salted with a hash's worth of random bytes; **rsa-pkcs1-***hash* on an
RSA key, deterministic; **ml-dsa-44**, **ml-dsa-65**, **ml-dsa-87** and
the twelve **slh-dsa** sets on their own keys. *hash* is any of the
plain hashes above.

**--context ***value*  
The context string for Ed25519 (which then signs in the Ed25519ctx
form), ML-DSA and SLH-DSA; up to 255 bytes. Empty without it, which for
Ed25519 is the plain form. Refused by the other schemes.

**--raw-ecdsa**  
An ECDSA signature as the fixed-width *r* followed by *s*, rather than
the DER SEQUENCE that **openssl dgst** writes. Ed25519, ML-DSA and
SLH-DSA signatures are always the fixed-width bytes their standards
define, and RSA signatures the modulus length.

## kex agree

**scytale kex agree** *algorithm* **-k ***private* **-p ***peer*
\[**--hex**\|**--raw**\] \[*-o file*\]

The shared secret between the private key in *private* and the peer's
public key in *peer*, under **x25519**, **ecdh-p256** or **ecdh-p384**;
both keys must be for it. Hex without a flag. A shared secret is keying
material, not a key; derive keys from it with **kdf hkdf**.

## kem encapsulate

**scytale kem encapsulate** *algorithm* **-p ***public* **--secret-out
***file* \[**--hex**\|**--raw**\] \[*-o file*\]

A ciphertext for the public key in *public*, under **ml-kem-512**,
**ml-kem-768** or **ml-kem-1024**, to standard output or **-o**, and the
shared secret it carries to *file*, created readable by its owner alone.
Raw bytes without a flag, for both. The peer recovers the secret from
the ciphertext with the private key.

## kem decapsulate

**scytale kem decapsulate** *algorithm* **-k ***private*
\[**--hex**\|**--raw**\] \[*-o file*\] \[*file*\]

The shared secret a ciphertext carries; hex without a flag. A ciphertext
that was not made for the key yields a secret that matches nothing,
rather than an error, as FIPS 203 requires.

## pke encrypt, pke decrypt

**scytale pke** {**encrypt**\|**decrypt**} *scheme* {**-p public**\|**-k
private**} \[*--label value*\] \[*-o file*\] \[*file*\]

RSA-OAEP under **rsa-oaep-***hash* for any of the plain hashes: a short
message, at most the modulus length less twice the hash length less two
bytes, under an RSA public key. The label is empty without **--label**,
and must match to decrypt. A ciphertext that does not decrypt exits with
status 1 and says nothing more.

## ALGORITHM NAMES

**scytale list** prints every name, and **scytale list** *family*
**--long** what each takes. Names are lower case with hyphens, and name
the whole construction, key width included: **aes-256-gcm**,
**hmac-sha3-256**, **rsa-pss-sha256**, **ml-dsa-65**. A key of another
width than the name says is refused rather than taken as a hint.

## EXIT STATUS

**0**  
Success, including a verification that passed.

**1**  
A tag, signature, padding or check value did not verify: the message is
not what was made under this key.

**2**  
The request could not be carried out as asked: an unknown name, an
option the algorithm does not take, a value in the wrong form, a key of
the wrong length, a file that is not a key or holds the wrong kind.

**3**  
Anything else: a file that would not open, a generator that would not
seed.

Errors go to standard error as **scytale ***command verb algorithm***:**
followed by what is wrong and what would be right, naming the option
concerned and a length or a name; the bytes of a value are never shown.
When the reader of standard output goes away, the tool stops quietly
with status 0, as the coreutils do.

## EXAMPLES

Encrypt a file to a key held in a file, with a header authenticated
alongside it, and decrypt it again:

    scytale random 32 --raw -o session.key
    scytale random 12 > nonce.hex
    scytale aead encrypt aes-256-gcm -k file:session.key \
        -n hex:$(cat nonce.hex) --aad str:v1 report.pdf -o report.sealed
    scytale aead decrypt aes-256-gcm -k file:session.key \
        -n hex:$(cat nonce.hex) --aad str:v1 report.sealed -o report.pdf

Sign a release with a post-quantum key and check the signature:

    scytale key generate ml-dsa-65 -o release.pem
    scytale key public release.pem -o release.pub
    scytale sig sign ml-dsa-65 -k release.pem release.tar -o release.sig
    scytale sig verify ml-dsa-65 -p release.pub -s file:release.sig \
        release.tar

Agree a key with a peer and derive session keys from it:

    scytale key generate x25519 -o me.pem
    scytale key public me.pem -o me.pub
    scytale kex agree x25519 -k me.pem -p peer.pub --raw -o shared.bin
    scytale kdf hkdf sha256 --ikm file:shared.bin --salt str:session-1 \
        --info str:encrypt --length 32

Read a key from a descriptor rather than the command line:

    scytale mac tag hmac-sha256 -k fd:3 message.txt 3< mac.key

Decrypt what **openssl enc** encrypted:

    openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -K $KEY -iv $IV < plain > cipher
    scytale cipher decrypt aes-128-cbc -k hex:$KEY --iv hex:$IV \
        --padding pkcs7 < cipher
