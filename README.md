# Scytale

Scytale (pronounced /ˈskɪtəliː/) is a high quality cryptographic library
written in Rust.
Our goal is to provide **fast** and **correct** implementations of common
cryptographic algorithms and services.

Scytale is in early development.
The following algorithms are currently available:
- SHA2-224
- SHA2-256
- SHA2-384
- SHA2-512
- SHA2-512/224
- SHA2-512/256
